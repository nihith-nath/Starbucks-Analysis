analyzing the Nutrition Facts of Starbucks Menu 

## Why I Started this Project

I love being a barista at Starbucks, creating delicious drinks for customers. It's not just about coffeeâ€”it's about understanding what goes into each cup. With a goal for a healthier lifestyle, I wanted to dig into the nutrition details of Starbucks beverages, like sugars and calories. As a data science student, this project blends my love for coffee with my academic journey.

# â˜• Starbucks Nutrition Data Analysis ðŸ“Š

## ðŸš€ Why I Started this Project

I love being a barista at Starbucks, creating delicious drinks for customers. It's not just about coffeeâ€”it's about understanding what goes into each cup. With a goal for a healthier lifestyle, I wanted to dig into the nutrition details of Starbucks beverages, like sugars and calories. As a data science student, this project blends my love for making coffee with my academic journey.

## ðŸ“Œ Data Source

Being mindful of what I eat and focusing on fitness, I realized the importance of informed choices. That's when I decided to explore a Kaggle dataset on Starbucks nutrition. The data provided a deep dive into the nutritional content of various drinks, giving me insights and helping me make healthier decisions.

## Project Structure

ðŸš€ The project is organized into different sections, each addressing specific aspects of the Starbucks nutrition data analysis.

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values and dropped rows with empty values.
- Converted data types of certain columns to ensure consistency and ease of analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Visualization 1: Beverage Category Distribution
- Utilized a horizontal bar graph to showcase the distribution of beverages under each beverage category.
- Highlighted counts for better understanding.

#### Visualization 2: Average Nutrition Values
- Presented boxplots of various nutrition values, providing insights into the distribution and central tendencies.

#### Visualization 3: Calories in Beverages
- Created a bar plot to visualize the calorie content across different beverage types.

#### Visualization 4: Distribution of Various Nutrition Values
- Displayed histograms for a comprehensive overview of the distribution of key nutrition values.

#### Visualization 5: Word Cloud
- Developed a word cloud representing beverage categories, beverages, and beverage preparations, offering a visual representation of the most frequent terms.

### 3. Correlation Analysis
- Conducted correlation analysis using a heatmap to explore relationships between different nutritional variables.

### 4. Scatter Plots

#### Scatter Plot 1: Calories vs Sugars
- Explored the relationship between calories and sugars, categorizing data by beverage category.

#### Scatter Plot 2: Calories vs Cholesterol
- Investigated the correlation between calories and cholesterol, considering beverage categories.

#### Scatter Plot 3: Sugars vs Cholesterol
- Examined the interplay between sugars and cholesterol, differentiated by beverage category.

#### Scatter Plot 4: Calories vs Total Fat
- Explored the surprising relationship (or lack thereof) between calories and total fat in beverages.

## Conclusion

ðŸŒŸ This project not only enhances my understanding of Starbucks nutrition but also serves as a valuable resource for anyone seeking insights into the nutritional aspects of their favorite Starbucks drinks. It combines my passion for coffee with data science skills, emphasizing the importance of making informed and healthier choices.

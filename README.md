# â˜• Starbucks Nutrition Data Analysis ðŸ“Š

## ðŸš€ Why I Started this Project

I love being a barista at Starbucks, creating delicious drinks for customers. It's not just about coffeeâ€”it's about understanding what goes into each cup. With a goal for a healthier lifestyle, I wanted to dig into the nutrition details of Starbucks beverages, like sugars and calories. As a data science student, this project blends my love for coffee with my academic journey.

## ðŸ“Œ Data Source

Being mindful of what I eat and focusing on fitness, I realized the importance of informed choices. That's when I decided to explore a Kaggle dataset on Starbucks nutrition. The data provided a deep dive into the nutritional content of various drinks, giving me insights and helping me make healthier decisions.
